# omnifocus-caldav
An [OmniAutomation](https://www.omni-automation.com/omnifocus/) script to sync OmniFocus with Getting Things Gnome via CalDAV.

Note that it doesn't actually do anything yet. This is very much an aspirational work-in-progress.

See [gtg issue #569](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/569).
